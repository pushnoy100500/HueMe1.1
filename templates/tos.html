				</p>
				<p><h3>12. Warranty</h3>
				TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICES AND SERVICE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED TO THE CONTRARY IN A WRITING BY HUEME. HUEME DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AS TO THE SERVICES AND SERVICE MATERIALS. HUEME DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR SERVICE MATERIALS ARE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, RELIABLE, CURRENT OR ERROR-FREE. HUEME IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS OR OMISSIONS RELATING TO PRICING, TEXT OR PHOTOGRAPHY. WHILE HUEME ATTEMPTS TO MAKE YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES SAFE, HUEME CANNOT AND DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR ITS SERVERS ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS; THEREFORE, YOU SHOULD USE INDUSTRY-RECOGNIZED SOFTWARE TO DETECT AND DISINFECT VIRUSES FROM ANY DOWNLOAD.
				TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL HUEME OR THE HUEME PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR THE SERVICE MATERIALS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR RESULTING FROM RELIANCE ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES OR THAT RESULT FROM THE ONLINE OR OFFLINE CONDUCT OF YOU OR ANYONE ELSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BODILY INJURY, DEATH OR PROPERTY DAMAGE), MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELETION OF FILES OR USER CONTENT, ERRORS, DEFECTS, VIRUSES, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, WHETHER OR NOT RESULTING FROM ACTS OF GOD, COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO HUEME’S RECORDS, PROGRAMS OR SERVICES. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF HUEME OR THE HUEME PARTIES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR IMPUTED), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR TO THESE TERMS EXCEED ANY COMPENSATION YOU PAY, IF ANY, TO HUEME FOR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICES, OR, IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID EXPERTISE FOR THE USE OF ANY SERVICES, THE AMOUNT OF $25.00.
				SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
				</p>
				<p><h3>13. Arbitration</h3>
				Except for any dispute in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents, you and HueMe waive your respective rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in Los Angeles, California (or, alternatively, via telephone or video conference) before and in accordance with the rules of JAMS, which are available on the JAMS website. You either, acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
				<br/>
				YOU AND HUEME AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES IS PERSONAL TO YOU AND HUEME AND THAT YOU AND HUEME WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
				<br/>
				As limited by the Federal Arbitration Act, these Terms and the JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
				<br/>
				Any claim you may have arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred. You and HueMe agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to HueMe must be sent to info@hueme.ca.
				</p>
				<p><h3>14. Severability</h3>
				If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
				</p>
				<p><h3>15. Questions &amp; Contact Information</h3>
				Questions or comments about the Services may be directed to HueMe at info@hueme.ca.
